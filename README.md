# Soccer Analytics

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to constructing an end-to-end soccer data pipeline that covers:

1. **Data Extraction**  
2. **Data Loading**  
3. **Data Storage**  
4. **Data Transformation**  
5. **Machine Learning** (building xG models)  
6. **Data Visualizations** (generating a dashboard)  
7. **Soccer Chatbot** (to chat about soccer insights)

## Future Plans 
- On demand API to web scrape soccer data.
- Incorporate advanced ML/DL models for xG prediction.
- Implement a user-friendly interface for data visualization.
- Extend the chatbot functionality to answer more in-depth soccer-related queries.
