# Web Scraping Pipelines

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to build robust web scraping pipelines using Python. The notebook (`Soccer_Web_Scraping_Pipeline.ipynb`) contains code to automate data extraction from websites, process and clean the scraped data, and save it in a structured format. The pipeline is designed to handle common challenges like pagination, error handling, and dynamic content extraction.

## Features
- **Automated Data Extraction:** Uses Python libraries (e.g., `requests` and `BeautifulSoup`) to fetch and parse HTML content.
- **Data Cleaning:** Processes raw data to extract useful information.
- **Modular Pipeline Design:** Easily extendable and customizable for different scraping tasks.
- **Error Handling:** Includes mechanisms to manage timeouts, connection errors, and missing elements.

## Prerequisites
- Install the packages in the requirements.txt file
You can install these using `pip` (see [Installation](#installation)).

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Web_Scraping_Pipelines.git
   cd Web_Scraping_Pipelines
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
